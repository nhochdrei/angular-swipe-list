To bee able to use it, don't forget to import the `SwipeListModule` in your app.module.ts.

## Use

For the basic setup you need the ```<n3-swipe-list [data]="dataArray"></n3-swipe-list>``` html part and, of course, the object itself.
The advanced version: ```<n3-swipe-list [data]="dataArray" [options]="optionObject"></n3-swipe-list>```, you can use the `options` binding to style the list or to set own states.

Speaking of states, this swipe-list is capable of an additional display of the actual state which your list element is in.
